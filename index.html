          <h2>Hi, I'm Leo</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up and went to school in New Ross. I have mixed feelings
            about the place as I grew up during a period of deindustrialization
            which led to a deep recession in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. People
            were hit hard and many suffered from poverty, immigration and
            addiction with obvious anti-social consequences. Things have
            improved in many ways and I made this site to focus on the positive
            aspects of New Ross which has wonderful people, astounding natural
            beauty and mind-blowing history.
